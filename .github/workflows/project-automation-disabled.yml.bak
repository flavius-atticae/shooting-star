name: Project Board Automation (DISABLED - Needs PAT Setup)

# This workflow is currently disabled because it requires a Personal Access Token (PAT)
# with 'project' scope to access GitHub Projects v2.
#
# To enable this workflow:
# 1. Create a PAT with 'project' scope at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# 2. Add it as a repository secret named 'PROJECT_PAT'
# 3. Replace GITHUB_TOKEN with PROJECT_PAT in this workflow
# 4. Rename this file to project-automation.yml
#
# Current status: All issues are manually added to Project #5 "Shooting Star"

on:
  # Temporarily disabled - uncomment when PAT is configured
