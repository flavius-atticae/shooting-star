# Epic 1 Retrospective — Content Foundation and Code Conventions

Date: 2026-02-15
Epic: 1
Facilitator: Bob (Scrum Master)
Project Lead: Flavius

## Participants

- Alice (Product Owner)
- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Elena (Junior Dev)
- Flavius (Project Lead)

## Epic Summary

- Epic title: Content Foundation and Code Conventions
- Stories completed: 3/3
- Story status consistency: all Epic 1 stories are marked `done`
- Retrospective objective: extract system-level learnings and prepare the next implementation focus

## What Went Well

1. Stakeholder collaboration improved decision quality and reduced ambiguity during execution.
2. Project onboarding and handoff quality improved through clearer BMAD artifacts and explicit conventions.
3. Deterministic naming and structure conventions reduced implementation friction for both human and AI contributors.
4. Server/client boundary clarity improved via server-only naming discipline.

## Challenges and Growth Areas

1. Test strategy signal quality was inconsistent across contexts.
2. Standards for test-level responsibility needed clearer operational enforcement.
3. CI quality gates required clearer ownership and more deterministic interpretation.

## Deep Story Pattern Synthesis

### Common Success Patterns

- Documentation-driven implementation improved consistency across stories.
- Explicit file/path conventions reduced rework and review churn.
- Review follow-ups in Story 1.3 produced concrete quality gains in helper/spec reliability.

### Common Struggle Patterns

- Testing policy and quality gate interpretation appeared as recurring friction.
- Validation confidence varied between type/build checks and broader test-strategy confidence.

### Review Feedback Patterns

- Positive: strong acceptance criteria traceability and implementation discipline.
- Improvement needed: stronger alignment between test governance expectations and day-to-day implementation flow.

### Technical Debt Status

- Known debt item tracked: test strategy governance follow-up (linked to Epic 7/8 quality modernization trajectory).
- Debt is explicit and visible, not hidden.

## Previous Retrospective Continuity

- No prior retrospective existed for Epic 0.
- This document is the first formal continuity baseline for future follow-through tracking.

## Next Epic Preparation (Updated Direction)

## Significant Discovery

During this retrospective, the team identified a strategic alignment update:

- Immediate operational focus should prioritize Epic 8 (test strategy modernization and governance) before broader feature expansion.

### Why this is significant

- Root causes identified by Project Lead: standards clarity + CI/tooling reliability.
- Epic 8 directly addresses those root causes with explicit test-pyramid responsibilities and enforceable quality gates.

### Impact

- Next-epic preparation was reoriented from generic feature progression to quality-foundation hardening.
- Team alignment improved around a single quality-first execution path.

## Action Items

### Process

1. Publish a single-source test pyramid responsibility map in implementation guidance.
   - Owner: Bob (Scrum Master)
   - Deadline: before Epic 8 story execution starts
   - Success criteria: map is referenced by story templates and review checklist

2. Add a mandatory “test-level mapping” checkpoint to story review.
   - Owner: Alice (Product Owner)
   - Deadline: before first Epic 8 story enters review
   - Success criteria: each Story 8.x includes explicit level assignment and non-overlap rationale

### Technical

3. Define deterministic CI gate semantics for test strategy checks.
   - Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)
   - Deadline: before Epic 8 merge-gate enforcement step
   - Success criteria: failing gate reason and remediation path are explicit in CI output

4. Stabilize visual/test feedback interpretation workflow to reduce ambiguous failures.
   - Owner: Dana (QA Engineer)
   - Deadline: before Epic 8 visual governance story completion
   - Success criteria: triage rubric documented and applied consistently

### Documentation

5. Keep test conventions and governance docs synchronized with implemented CI behavior.
   - Owner: Elena (Junior Dev)
   - Deadline: at each Epic 8 story closure checkpoint
   - Success criteria: no drift between documented and observed pipeline behavior

## Team Agreements

1. No merge-gate change without documented rationale and reviewer visibility.
2. No test duplication across pyramid levels unless explicitly justified.
3. No retrospective action item closes without observable evidence.

## Readiness Assessment

- Epic 1 completion readiness: complete from story-delivery perspective.
- Remaining readiness focus: quality-governance maturation before scaling feature throughput.
- Stakeholder confidence: positive, conditional on Epic 8 follow-through.

## Commitments and Next Steps

1. Execute Epic 8 as the immediate strategic priority.
2. Track all retrospective actions in ongoing sprint ceremonies.
3. Re-evaluate quality signal reliability after Epic 8 governance milestones are implemented.
4. Use this retrospective as continuity baseline for next epic retrospective follow-through.

## Closing Note

Epic 1 established a stronger foundation in collaboration, contributor onboarding, and convention discipline. The team intentionally chose a quality-first next step by prioritizing Epic 8 to address root causes before expanding execution surface.
